          strong love for web design and digital creativity. I really enjoy crafting
          visually appealing and user-friendly experiences that bring ideas to
          life on the web. Besides coding and creating something creative, I'm a huge fan of video games, movies,
          and reading. Whether it's exploring immersive game worlds, diving into
          captivating stories, especailly horror genre, or analyzing great cinematography, I find
          inspiration in all forms of digital and visual storytelling. I'm
          always eager to learn, experiment, and grow as a developer. And I'm eager to jump into 
          my new path in life and meet other fantastic developers."
